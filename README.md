What is Brain machine interfacing (BMI) ?
Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are devices that bridge human brain and an external device. They can read human brain activity and communicate that information directly to a computer system. BMIs could help a patient control a robotic prosthesis or enable the user to type into a word processor using only their thoughts.

BMIs can either be invasive or non-invasive. Invasive brain mapping includes surgically implanting electrodes under the scalp to more accurately transmit brain impulses. On the other hand, non-invasive BMIs do not require surgery and are positioned over the head to monitor brain activity. 

Several decoding techniques are available to achieve BMI. One such technique is Electrocorticography (Ecog).
